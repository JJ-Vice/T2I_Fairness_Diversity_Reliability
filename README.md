# T2I_Fairness_Diversity_Reliability
A reliability and fairness evaluation framework for multimodal generative models. This repo provides tools to assess model robustness by analyzing responses to embedding-space perturbations, measuring generative diversity, and probing fairness under low guidance. Useful for detecting biased behaviors and tracing the origins of unreliable concepts
